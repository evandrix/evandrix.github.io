Extract the key!

Written by RyanWithZombies

Update: The key is not "flag{ don't trust the Cheshire cat!! he works for the Queen of Hearts }". Sorry about that. It's an artifact from an easier version of this challenge. You need to extract key.jpg.

HINT:

CSAWLZ is a completely custom format! You won't find decompressing tools on the internet. We made it just for you. :)

```
typedef struct _hdr {
    uint8_t magic[8];
    uint32_t version;
    uint32_t num_files;
} hdr;

typedef struct _entry {
    uint32_t magic;
    uint32_t compressed_size;
    uint32_t uncompressed_size;
    uint8_t filename[32];
} entry;
